This is a work in progress discord bot for an F1 rng game similar to what used to be available in the F1 discord.

Each race weekend, every player is assigned a random driver on the grid. At the end of the weekend each player earns the same points as their assigned driver, for example:

- Player 1 is given Verstappen, who finishes the race in P1 with fastest lap. Player 1 gets 26 points.
- Player 2 is given Leclerc, who finishes the race in P3. Player 2 gets 15 points.

The game is purely chance but it's fun to see where people end up and can conjure surprises (I remember when this game was in the F1 discord I got Ocon for Hungary 2021 which I was disappointed by at first... not so much after the race).

All the information will be stored in a google sheet and this bot essentially acts as an interface with that sheet, doubling as a way for players to enter the game and as a way to query the sheet for certain stats (i.e. the current points ranking across all players, the results for a specific race etc).

Aiming to have this done by the start of the 2024 season! At the very least the essential functionality.
